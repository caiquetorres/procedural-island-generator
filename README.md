# Procedural Island Generator

The project consists of a system that is capable of islands in a procedural way, that is, using a Unity engine and a set of algorithms the system creates more or less organic maps.

The height map of the islands is generated as base or perlin noise. The result of the generation without the colors can be seen below.

## Color map

Using the same height map, colors can be added by regions, generating the effect seen below.
